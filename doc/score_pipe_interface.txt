The Score 'pipe' Interface
==========================

So, there was a 'env' interface which provided K/V data to the score via
the environment.

That works for sending information to the score, but not for getting
information back.

To make that step, the 'pipe' interface has been built.

pipe reads line output in stdout from the executing process.  If the
line contains a '=', it's split at the first '=' for the Key and
Value, and they are stored in the responses.  All other output is
ignored.

To use this interface, the score's .conf file should contain:
----
interface=pipe
----
